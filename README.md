I used the postgreSQL for database collection and name it as abcSQL.For backend I used Golang.I am not familiar with this but I tried my best to get the output.I create a simple UI with your instructions first u have to log in with any username and password.If you don't type both there will be a error message.After you will gt into the dashboard where you can insert the details of items and invoices.I give you all the source codes but I am not deploy them.
